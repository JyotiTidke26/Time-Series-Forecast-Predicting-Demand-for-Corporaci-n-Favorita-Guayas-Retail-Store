# **Time Series Forecast Predicting Demand for Corporacion Favorita Guayas Retail Store**

This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning**-based sales forecasting model for different products across stores in the Guayas region. The predictions are visualized using a Streamlit web application, which allows users to select a store, item, and date to obtain sales forecasts.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends.
- Preprocessed data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Developed a forecasting model to predict sales for January‚ÄìMarch 2014.
- Built a Streamlit application for demand planners to interact with forecasts.

---

## üîç **Data Preprocessing**

- Filled missing dates with zero sales to ensure a continuous time series.
- Created lag features for trend analysis.
- Dropped rows with NaN values post-feature engineering.
- Merged data at the end of preprocessing to ensure consistency.

## ü§ñ **Model Choice & Justification**

Different models were tested and selected **XGBoost** for its best result and ability to capture complex patterns and interactions within the data.

---
## **Model Performance**

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 5.98  
  This metric indicates that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual sales by 5.98 units. A lower RMSE reflects better model accuracy.

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 2.24
  This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions. Smaller values indicate better model performance.

## üîß **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation**

Performed **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The tuning process involved evaluating different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best model based on **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

### **Key Steps in Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- **Hyperparameter Grid Search:**  
  A parameter grid was defined to test various values for `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, and `max_depth`.
  
- **TimeSeriesSplit for Cross-Validation:**  
  Used to maintain the chronological order of the data, preventing data leakage.

- **GridSearchCV:**  
  An exhaustive search was performed over the grid to identify the best hyperparameters.

### **Best Hyperparameters:**
- **Learning Rate:** 0.1
- **Max Depth:** 5
- **Number of Estimators:** 50

### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 5.76  
  This indicates the average deviation between predicted and actual sales values, with lower values reflecting better performance.

## üåç **Streamlit Web Application**

My Streamlit app allows users to:

- Select a store and item to forecast.
- Pick a date within the prediction range.
- Generate sales predictions interactively.
